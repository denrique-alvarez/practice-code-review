# Remove consecutive duplicates: Omer approach

---

## Strategy

1. Create a new array of words from a given string.
2. Iterate through the array.
3. Set a condition that checks if the previous element is equal to the current
   one.
4. In case the condition is met, send the element to a new array.
5. Turn the array into a string.
6. Return the final string.

## Implementation

**split() method**: Using split method, I created an array of words from given
string.

**empty array**: I created an empty array to push filtered array elements later.

**for loop**: To filter array elements I chose to use for loop.

**if statement**: if statement is used to find and eliminate repeated words.

**push() method**: Push method is used to send non-repeated words to a new empty
array.

**join() method**: At the end, in return, I used join method to combine
non-repeated words as a string.

## Use Cases

The function can be useful for revising writing mistakes of user's input in web
or software applications by deleting repeated words.

In collecting user data, inquiries, demands:

```js
const userInput = prompt('Enter your question please?');
const isAnyTypo = removeConsecutiveDuplicates(userInput);
if (isAnyTypo !== userInput) {
  confirm(`Did you mean "${isAnyTypo}"`);
} else {
  const message =
    'Thanks! We received your message and we will get back to you as soon as possible.';
  alert(message);
}
```

For text or essay revision:

```js
const userEssay = prompt('Enter your essay here..');
const revisedEssay = removeConsecutiveDuplicates(userEssay);
alert(revisedEssay);
```

## Inspiration

I solved the challenge with my current knowledge, but later I improved it with
the inspiration of [Imahori's solution]
(<https://www.codewars.com/kata/reviews/5b39e927e7a2c103300018b5/groups/5b3a6472615a90b74d000e04>).
Basically, I was assuming that I can't check arr[i]!==arr[i-1] when i=0, because
it would be arr[-1] and undefined. But from his solution, I see that it is
possible. When you check if(arr[0]!==arr[-1]) , it results true. It means that
arr[0]!==undefined is true. Then, I refactored the solution. My solution becomes
shorter and cleaner than my previous solution.
